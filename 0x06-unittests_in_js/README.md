# 0x06. Unittests in JS

## Description

What I learnt as I did tasks in this project:

```
How to use Mocha to write a test suite
How to use different assertion libraries (Node or Chai)
How to present long test suites
When and how to use spies
When and how to use stubs
What are hooks and when to use them
Unit testing with Async functions
How to write integration tests with a small node server

```

## Tasks
+ [x] [0. Basic test with Mocha and Node assertion library](./package.json)

* Install Mocha using npm:

+ [x] [1. Combining descriptions](./1-calcul.js)

* Create a new file named 1-calcul.js:

+ [x] [2. Basic test using Chai assertion library](./2-calcul_chai.js)

* While using Node assert library is completely valid, a lot of developers prefer to have a behavior driven development style. This type being easier to read and therefore to maintain.

+ [x] [3. Spies](./utils.js)

* Spies are a useful wrapper that will execute the wrapped function, and log useful information (e.g. was it called, with what arguments). Sinon is a library allowing you to create spies.

+ [x] [4. Stubs](./4-payment.js)

* Stubs are similar to spies. Except that you can provide a different implementation of the function you are wrapping. Sinon can be used as well for stubs.

+ [x] [5. Hooks](./5-payment.js)

* Hooks are useful functions that can be called before execute one or all tests in a suite

+ [x] [6. Async tests with done](./6-payment_token.js)

* Look into how to support async testing, for example when waiting for the answer of an API or from a Promise

+ [x] [7. Skip](./7-skip.test.js)

* When you have a long list of tests, and you canâ€™t figure out why a test is breaking, avoid commenting out a test, or removing it. Skip it instead, and file a ticket to come back to it as soon as possible

+ [x] [8. Basic Integration testing](./8-api/package.json)

* In a folder 8-api located at the root of the project directory, copy this package.json over.

+ [x] [9. Regex integration testing](./9-api/api.js)

* In a folder 9-api, reusing the previous project in 8-api (package.json, api.js and api.test.js)

+ [x] [10. Deep equality & Post integration testing](./10-api/api.js)

* In a folder 10-api, reusing the previous project in 9-api (package.json, api.js and api.test.js)
