# 0x05. NodeJS Basics

## Description
   + what I learnt as I did this project:
```
run javascript using NodeJS
use NodeJS modules
use specific Node JS module to read files
use process to access command line arguments and the environment
create a small HTTP server using Node JS
create a small HTTP server using Express JS
create advanced routes with Express JS
use ES6 with Node JS with Babel-node
use Nodemon to develop faster
Node JS getting started
Process API doc
Child process
Express getting started
Mocha documentation
Nodemon documentation
```

+ [x] [0. Executing basic javascript with Node JS](./0-console.js)

* In the file 0-console.js, create a function named displayMessage that prints in STDOUT the string argument.

+ [x] [1. Using Process stdin](./1-stdin.js)

* Create a program named 1-stdin.js that will be executed through command line:

+ [x] [2. Reading a file synchronously with Node JS](./2-read_file.js)

* Using the database database.csv (provided in project description), create a function countStudents in the file 2-read_file.js

+ [x] [3. Reading a file asynchronously with Node JS](./3-read_file_async.js)

* Using the database database.csv (provided in project description), create a function countStudents in the file 3-read_file_async.js

+ [x] [4. Create a small HTTP server using Node's HTTP module](./4-http.js)

* In a file named 4-http.js, create a small HTTP server using the http module:

+ [x] [5. Create a more complex HTTP server using Node's HTTP module](./5-http.js)

* In a file named 5-http.js, create a small HTTP server using the http module:

+ [x] [6. Create a small HTTP server using Express](./6-http_express.js)

* Install Express and in a file named 6-http_express.js, create a small HTTP server using Express module:

+ [x] [7. Create a more complex HTTP server using Express](./7-http_express.js)

* In a file named 7-http_express.js, recreate the small HTTP server using Express:

+ [x] [8. Organize a complex HTTP server using Express](./full_server/utils.js)

* Obviously writing every part of a server within a single file is not sustainable. Letâ€™s create a full server in a directory named full_server.
